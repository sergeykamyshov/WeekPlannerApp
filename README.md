## Week Planner

Week Planner is an Android application that helps you to organize tasks by cards and plan your week.

The main goal of the application is to allow you to create 3-4 cards with 2-3 tasks, that will help you to approach goal for this week.

In the end of week check what was done and plan next week. 

All your cards save to archive and you can review it anytime.

Week Planner is a personal project that I created for myself. 
If you have an idea how improve the app, please give me feedback.
